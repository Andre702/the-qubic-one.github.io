			<h2>1.2. Mail System</h2>

			<h3>1.2.1. Protocols POP3, IMAP, SMTP, client server communication, basic commands</h3>

			<p><b>POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)</b> - a protocol used for retrieving email messages from a mail server.
			It allows a client to download messages from a server and store them locally.</p>

			<p><b>IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)</b> - a protocol used for retrieving email messages from a mail server.
			Unlike POP3, IMAP allows the client to access and manipulate messages on the server without downloading them.</p>

			<p><b>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</b> - a protocol used for sending email messages.
			It allows a client to transmit a message to a server, which then forwards the message to the intended recipient(s).
			SMTP is the standard protocol used for sending email on the internet.</p>

			<br>
			<b>client-server communication</b>
			
			<p>In a client-server mail system, user's computer runs the email client and communicates with the email server to send and receive messages.
				When a user wants to check their email, the client sends a request to the server using the POP3 or IMAP protocol.</p>

			<p>To send an email, the client sends the message to the server using the SMTP protocol.
				The server then forwards the message to the recipient's email server.</p>

			<!-- basic commands -->
			<br>
			<b>The most essential commands for interacting with a mail server:</b>

    		<p><b>POP3</b>: USER (sends username), PASS (sends password), RETR (retrieves a message), DELE (deletes a message)</p>
    		<p><b>IMAP</b>: LOGIN (sends username and password), SELECT (selects a mailbox), FETCH (retrieves info about messages), STORE (modifies flags)</p>
    		<p><b>SMTP</b>: MAIL FROM (specifies sender), RCPT TO (specifies recipient), DATA (sends the message body)</p>

			<p>These commands are used for authenticating,
				retrieving and deleting messages from mail server (POP3 and IMAP),
				and sending messages (SMTP).</p>

			<h3>1.2.2. NNTP protocol</h3>
			<p><b>NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol)</b> - a protocol used for distributing and retrieving Usenet articles.
				Usenet is a global network of servers that store and distribute newsgroup articles.
				NNTP is used to connect to a Usenet server, retrieve articles from newsgroups, and post new articles to newsgroups.</p>
			
			<h3>1.2.3. E-mail mailbox, parameters, aliases, address</h3>
			<p><b>E-mail mailbox</b> - a storage location on a mail server where incoming and outgoing email messages are stored.
				Each mailbox is associated with a unique email address,
				and can be accessed by the owner of the mailbox using a mail client.</p>

			<b>Parameters:</b>
			
			<ul>
				<li>To: recipient's address</li>
				<li>From: sender's address</li>
				<li>Subject: brief summary</li>
				<li>CC: Carbon Copy - Additional recipients</li>
				<li>BCC: Blind Carbon Copy - hidden carbon copy</li>
				<li>Reply-To: address for sending replies</li>
				<li>Date: date and time</li>
				<li>Message-ID: A unique identifier for the email</li>
				<li>In-Reply-To: The Message-ID of the email that this email is in reply to</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>1.2.4. E-mail structure: header, separator</h3>
			<p>An e-mail consists of two parts: header and body. The header holds information related to to the message itself,
				while body holds the contents of the message.</p>
			<p>separator is a string of characters (typically a blank line, but can depend on the email system)
				used to separate the different parts of an email message, i.e. header and body.</p>
			
			<h3>1.2.5. Attachements, e-mail coding, MIME</h3>
			<p>Attachments are files that are sent along with email messages.
				When a file is attached to an email, it is encoded into a format that can be sent as part of the email message.
				The most common encoding format is Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME). The attachments are usually a part of the body.</p>
			<p>Additionaly, e-mails can include HTML and CSS code, which allows for creating visually appealing and professional-looking e-mails.
				It is worth noting that not all email clients support the same level of HTML and CSS.</p>

			<h3>1.2.6. Mailing lists, e-mail gate</h3>
			<p><b>Mailing list</b> - a collection of email addresses that are used to send messages to multiple recipients at once.
				Mailing lists can be used for a variety of purposes, such as sending newsletters, announcements, or discussion forums.
				They can be moderated, this is done to avoid spam or unwanted messages.</p>

			<p><b>Email Gateway</b> - a system that acts as a bridge between different email systems and networks.
				It is used to process and filter incoming and outgoing email messages,
				and to perform various functions such as spam filtering, virus scanning, and message encryption.</p>

			<h3>1.2.7. E-mail security, ssl, tls, PGP, signature</h3>
			<p></p>

			<h3>1.2.8. Spam, blacklists, graylists, spam filtering</h3>
			<p></p>
